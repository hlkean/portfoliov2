I have also strived to improve analytics and performance monitoring which has lead to an increase in app store ratings, decrease in customer service calls, and decrease in crash rates across all apps. In order to ensure the longterm success of the project and team, I create, maintain, and update shared documentation across subjects such as our tech stack, tools, and various procedural guidelines.</p>",

During my time with the company I worked to not only raise awareness of these issues, but to rebuild and optimize pages so that it could track and grow its organic traffic. It saw its organic traffic grow significantly which directly lead to an increase in paid users and revenue for the company.</p><p>I also worked to push the team towards a consolidated code base built with a single API and front-end that was structured based on a consistent design language and style guide. When I first started there were three different web frameworks (Ember.js, Vue.js, CodeIgniter)  with two different backend resources (CodeIgniter, and a Laravel based API). Now it is building a single front-end component library in Vue.js based on a style guide to decrease development time and the need for design QA. The team also consolidated its backend resources into a single Laravel API so that the code would stay concise and in one place.</p>",

To keep cost low I built the site using <a href='https://getgrav.org/' target='_blank'>Grav CMS</a>, a free flat file content management system with a large community so I had resources to turn to in case I encountered any issues or challenges along the way. I then chose to deploy the site using <a href='https://www.heroku.com/' target='_blank'>Heroku</a>. While this proved to be a more difficult route than using AWS or Google Cloud Platform, it wound up being the most cost effective solution (maximum $7/month) since I needed support for PHP and the potential to read and write to the server numerous times a month for content updates.</p><p>Working closely with Bog’s founder we were able to launch a site in roughly a month’s time, that met their financial needs and gave them the ability to freely update the sites content.</p>",
