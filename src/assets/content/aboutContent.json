Combing an education in psychology with a master’s degree in Interactive media, I love to think up new projects or solutions to problems backed by qualitative and quantitative data. I thrive in collaborative project environments where I can learn from, work alongside, and mentor those around me.</p><p>Though my job title has primarily been as an engineer, I have contributed insights and ideas to international digital campaigns for enterprise level clients, helped win new business, won startup competitions, and aided in developing a business growing measurement culture in a startup. Below you'll find an ever expanding list of tools that I've used along the way to help create and build some amazing projects:</p><ul><li>Front-end: HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript/jQuery/ES6</li><li>Front-end Frameworks: React, React Native, Vue, Ember</li><li>Backend: PHP/Laravel/CodeIgniter, MySQL, Node.js, GraphQL</li><li>SEO/Metrics: SEMRush, Google Search Console, Lighthouse, Google Analytics, Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Crashlytics</li><li>CMS: Grav, Hippo, Wordpress</li><li>Design/Creative: Adobe Creative Cloud (primarily Photoshop, Illustrator, and AfterEffects), Sketch</li><li>Other: Git, Gulp, Atlassian Productivity Suite</li></ul><p>I’m always looking for new experiences.
